# NYC_COLLISIONS_ANALYSIS

## INTRODUCTION
This analysis examines 238,000+ vehicle collisions (2015-2020) in New York City. The Power BI dashboard identifies high-risk locations, times, and contributing factors to improve road safety strategies and urban planning.

This project explores NYC collision data to uncover patterns in accident types, victim demographics, and environmental factors that contribute to incidents.

## KEY FINDINGS
- Most Dangerous Borough: Brooklyn (76K collisions)

- Worst Street: Belt Parkway (3,700+ crashes)

- Peak Time: Afternoon (68K incidents)

- Top Cause: Distracted driving (109 fatal cases)

## POWER BI TOOLS USED
- Borough-specific filters

- Time-of-day heatmaps

- Contributing factor breakdowns

- Street-level collision clustering

## SKILLS / CONCEPTS DEMONSTRATED
- Power Query data cleaning

- DAX measures for fatality rates

- Custom visualizations (heatmaps, trend lines)

## ANALYSIS
## Monthly Trends Show a Drop in Accidents

Sharp decline in collisions between March and April , likely due to COVID-19 lockdowns . March had the highest percentage of collisions, December had the lowest.

Collisions rise early in the year, peak around March, and decline toward year-end. 

## Time of day

Most accidents occurred in the  Afternoon(68k) and Morning(64k) (peak accident periods), likely due to rush hours, school runs, and work commutes. Accidents reduce progressively toward the evening, suggesting less road congestion or reduced activity.

Night collisions(57k) are still significant, possibly due to visibility issues or fatigued driving.

## Day of the week

Friday had the highest collision frequency which reflects increased commuting, social activities, or end-of-week fatigue.

Sunday had the least.

## Most Accident-Prone Street

Belt Parkway had the most accidents (3.7K)

This represents around 1.56% of all reported accidents â€” highest for a single street.

## Most Common Contributing Factor (Vehicle 1) and Fatal Accidents

Physical Disability was the top contributing factor reported for vehicle 1(109 incidents) in non-fatal cases, followed by Using Navigation Device, other electronic device, vehicle vandalism and Eating/Drinking.

For fatalities motorists and pedestrians were highly affected.

## Vehicle type

Passenger vehicles were involved in the vast majority of collisions(96.81%), indicating high usage on NYC roads, possibly more individual trips than commercial transport. Transport vehicles was over (3%).

## Borough Breakdown
 Brooklyn had the highest number of collisions(76k), possibly due to higher population density, more road networks or traffic congestion.

Staten Island reports the fewest (12k).

## RECOMMENDATION & CONCLUSION  
- Targeted Awareness Campaigns

Educate drivers on the dangers of distractions (especially mobile navigation and devices).

Promote cyclist and pedestrian safety, especially in high-risk areas.

- Street-Level Interventions

Investigate Belt Parkway and Broadway for engineering redesigns, better signage, and stricter enforcement.

Introduce smart traffic systems or speed control on high-incident streets.

-  Time-Specific Patrols

Increase traffic monitoring during morning and afternoon peaks, and especially on Fridays.

-  Vehicle-Specific Measures

Require better safety compliance for passenger vehicles, given their overwhelming involvement in accidents.

- Data-Driven Urban Planning

Use the trends to redesign road usage policies, improve pedestrian pathways and add bike lanes in high-collision zones.

This NYC collision data analysis reveals clear patterns in timing, location, and type of road users affected. By using data to target specific times, streets, and behaviors, city authorities can reduce both injuries and fatalities. Data-driven traffic policy is essential for creating safer urban mobility systems.
